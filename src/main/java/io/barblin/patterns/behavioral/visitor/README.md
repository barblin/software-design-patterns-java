The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a new operation on a group of related objects without changing their class hierarchy. Here are some common uses of the Visitor pattern:

- Adding new operations: The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations to a group of related objects without changing their class hierarchy. This is useful when you have a large and complex class hierarchy and you want to add new functionality without making the classes even more complex.


- Separating concerns: The Visitor pattern separates the concerns of the operations from the objects that they operate on. This separation of concerns makes it easier to modify the operations independently of the objects.


- Extending functionality: The Visitor pattern allows you to extend the functionality of a group of related objects without changing their existing behavior. This is useful when you have existing code that you don't want to change, but you want to add new functionality.


- Encapsulating algorithms: The Visitor pattern encapsulates algorithms in their own classes, which makes it easier to modify and reuse them independently of the code that uses them.


- Implementing double-dispatch: The Visitor pattern can be used to implement double-dispatch, where the actual method that gets called depends on the runtime types of both the visitor and the visited objects.


Overall, the Visitor pattern is useful when you have a large and complex class hierarchy and you want to add new operations without changing the existing classes. By encapsulating operations in their own classes and providing a common interface, you can separate the concerns of the operations from the objects that they operate on. This can lead to more flexible and modular code that is easier to maintain and extend over time.
