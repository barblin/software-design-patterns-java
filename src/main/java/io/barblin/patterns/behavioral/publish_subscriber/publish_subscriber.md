The publish/subscribe pattern is a popular design pattern in software engineering that is used to decouple message
producers (publishers) from message consumers (subscribers). Here are some common use cases for the publish/subscribe
pattern:

- Event-driven systems: In event-driven systems, multiple components or services may need to react to the same event.
  For example, in a stock trading system, several components may need to receive real-time updates when the price of a
  stock changes. The publish/subscribe pattern can be used to send these updates to all the interested components,
  without having to know the identity of each component.


- User interface updates: User interfaces often have multiple components that need to update based on changes in data.
  The publish/subscribe pattern can be used to notify each component of changes in the data it's interested in, without
  tightly coupling the data and the user interface components.


- Log aggregation and analysis: In large distributed systems, logs are often generated by multiple servers and services.
  The publish/subscribe pattern can be used to collect and process these logs in a centralized location, where
  subscribers can analyze and take actions based on the log data.


- IoT (Internet of Things) systems: IoT systems often have multiple sensors that generate data. The publish/subscribe
  pattern can be used to distribute this data to multiple subscribers who may need to react to different events based on
  the sensor data.


- Message brokers: Message brokers are used to route messages between producers and consumers in a distributed system.
  The publish/subscribe pattern can be used to build message brokers that allow publishers and subscribers to exchange
  messages without knowing about each other.

Overall, the publish/subscribe pattern is useful in any system that needs to exchange information between multiple
components or services without tightly coupling them. It provides a flexible way to handle message delivery, making it
easier to add or remove components from the system without affecting the rest of the system.
