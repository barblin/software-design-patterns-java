The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable at runtime. Here are some common uses of the Strategy pattern:

- Encapsulating algorithms: The Strategy pattern encapsulates algorithms in their own classes, which makes it easier to modify and reuse them independently of the code that uses them.


- Separating concerns: The Strategy pattern separates the concerns of selecting and executing an algorithm from the concerns of the algorithm's implementation. This separation of concerns makes it easier to modify the selection process or the algorithm's implementation independently.


- Configuring behavior at runtime: The Strategy pattern allows you to select and configure an algorithm at runtime, which makes it easy to switch between different strategies without changing the code that uses them.


- Promoting code reuse: The Strategy pattern promotes code reuse by allowing you to define a family of related algorithms and reuse them across different parts of your application.


- Simplifying complex logic: The Strategy pattern can be used to simplify complex logic by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.


Overall, the Strategy pattern is useful when you have multiple algorithms that you want to use interchangeably, or when you need to select an algorithm at runtime based on certain criteria. By encapsulating algorithms as objects and providing a common interface, you can separate the concerns of selecting and executing an algorithm from the concerns of its implementation. This can lead to more flexible and modular code that is easier to maintain and extend over time.
