The memento design pattern is useful when the internal state of an object should be stored externally to be able to restore 
an object to that state. This pattern does so, without violating an object's encapsulation.

Here are some common use cases for the mediator pattern:

- An application where you want to maintain a history of snapshots, for example a graphical editor.


- In game state management. You can use the memento pattern to maintain a history of quick saves.
