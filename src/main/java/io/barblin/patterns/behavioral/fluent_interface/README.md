The Fluent Interface pattern is useful when you want to create code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. By using
a fluent, natural syntax, you can improve the readability of your code, reduce errors, and provide discoverability to
other developers. This pattern can be especially useful when working with complex object hierarchies and when you want
to promote code reuse.

Here are some common uses of the Fluent Interface pattern:

- Improved readability: The Fluent Interface pattern makes code more readable by allowing method calls to be chained
  together in a natural, flowing manner. This can make code easier to read and understand, especially when working with
  complex object hierarchies.


- Reducing errors: By using a Fluent Interface, it is easier to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Since
  methods return the same object, you can see if a method is called that shouldn't be in that sequence.


- Providing discoverability: A well-designed Fluent Interface provides discoverability to developers by presenting a
  clear set of options for what methods can be called next. This makes it easier for developers to explore and
  experiment with the code, and can lead to a better understanding of how the code works.


- Promoting code reuse: The Fluent Interface pattern promotes code reuse by allowing the same object to be configured in
  different ways using a common interface. This can simplify the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend over
  time.


- Supporting method chaining: The Fluent Interface pattern supports method chaining, which can be useful for creating
  complex object hierarchies. Method chaining allows for a fluent, natural syntax that can be used to build up an object
  in a step-by-step manner.
