The Chain of Responsibility design pattern can be used in several scenarios where a series of objects are involved in processing a request, and each object may or may not be able to handle the request. Some common use cases for the Chain of Responsibility pattern include:

- Handling user input: In graphical user interfaces, user input may need to be processed by several components in a specific order. For example, a user's input may first be checked for validity, then parsed for specific commands, and finally acted upon. The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to create a chain of handlers to process the user input in the correct order.


- Logging and error handling: When an application generates an error or log event, multiple components may need to process the event in a specific order. For example, an error may need to be logged, an alert may need to be sent to the system administrator, and the user may need to be notified. The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to create a chain of handlers to process the error or log event in the correct order.


- Request processing: In server-side applications, incoming requests may need to be processed by multiple components in a specific order. For example, a request may first need to be authenticated, then authorized, and finally processed. The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to create a chain of handlers to process the request in the correct order.

Overall, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is useful in situations where a series of objects need to process a request in a specific order, but the exact handling of the request may vary based on the object in the chain. The pattern allows for flexible and extensible processing of requests by allowing new handlers to be added or removed from the chain without affecting the existing handlers.
