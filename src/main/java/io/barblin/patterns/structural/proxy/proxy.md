The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object in order to control access to it or add additional functionality. The Proxy pattern is useful in a variety of situations, such as:

- Remote Proxy: A remote proxy provides a local representation of an object that resides in a different address space, such as on a different server or in a different process. This can help to reduce network latency and improve performance by avoiding the need to send all requests to the remote object.


- Virtual Proxy: A virtual proxy provides a placeholder for an expensive object that is only created when it is actually needed. This can help to reduce memory usage and improve performance by delaying the creation of the object until it is actually needed.


- Protection Proxy: A protection proxy provides a security wrapper around an object in order to control access to it. This can help to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that only authorized users are able to interact with the object.

Smart Proxy: A smart proxy provides additional functionality beyond that provided by the original object, such as caching, logging, or performance monitoring.
