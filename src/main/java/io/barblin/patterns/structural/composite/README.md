The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat groups of objects in the same way as individual objects. Here are some common use cases of the Composite pattern:

- Hierarchical structures: The Composite pattern is often used to represent hierarchical structures, such as file systems, organization charts, or menus. By treating groups of objects as if they were individual objects, the Composite pattern allows the structure to be navigated and manipulated easily.


- Recursive structures: The Composite pattern can be used to represent recursive structures, such as mathematical expressions or family trees. By treating groups of objects as if they were individual objects, the Composite pattern allows the structure to be processed recursively, simplifying the code.


- Uniform interfaces: The Composite pattern provides a uniform interface for working with both individual objects and groups of objects. This can simplify the code by allowing the same methods to be used on both types of objects.


- Component-based architectures: The Composite pattern can be used in component-based architectures, where a system is built from individual components that can be combined in different ways. By treating components as if they were individual objects, the Composite pattern allows the system to be easily extended and customized.


- Graphics and user interfaces: The Composite pattern is often used in graphics and user interface frameworks to represent complex structures of graphical elements. By treating groups of elements as if they were individual elements, the Composite pattern allows the structure to be easily manipulated and rendered.


Overall, the Composite pattern is useful in situations where you need to work with hierarchical or recursive structures, or where a uniform interface for working with groups of objects is needed. By treating groups of objects as if they were individual objects, the Composite pattern can simplify the code and make it easier to work with complex structures.
