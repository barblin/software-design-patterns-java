The Facade pattern is a software design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to use and understand. Here are two common use cases of the Facade pattern:

- Simplifying a complex system: \
A system can have multiple layers and components that are tightly coupled, making it difficult to use and understand. The Facade pattern can simplify the system by providing a unified interface that hides the complexity of the individual components. The Facade acts as a layer that shields the client from the complex implementation details of the system. This can make it easier for developers to work with the system and can also improve the maintainability of the code.


- Creating a modular system:\
The Facade pattern can also be used to create a modular system. By defining a Facade interface for each module, you can encapsulate the functionality of each module and provide a simple interface for other modules to use. This can make it easier to maintain and update the system since each module can be developed and tested independently.

Overall, the Facade pattern can help improve the overall design of a system by simplifying it and making it more modular. It can also improve the readability and maintainability of the code by hiding implementation details behind a simple interface.
