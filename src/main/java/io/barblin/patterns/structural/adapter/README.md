The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. Here are some common use cases of the Adapter pattern:

- Integrating legacy code: The Adapter pattern is often used to integrate legacy code into a new application. By adapting the legacy code to conform to the new application's interface, the Adapter pattern allows the legacy code to be used in the new application.


- Supporting multiple interfaces: The Adapter pattern can be used to create a single class that supports multiple interfaces. By adapting the class's interface to the different interfaces, the Adapter pattern allows the class to be used in multiple contexts.


- Reusing existing classes: The Adapter pattern can be used to reuse existing classes in a new context. By adapting the existing class's interface to the new context, the Adapter pattern allows the existing class to be used in the new context without modification.


- Implementing third-party APIs: The Adapter pattern is often used to implement third-party APIs that have incompatible interfaces. By adapting the third-party API to conform to the application's interface, the Adapter pattern allows the third-party API to be used in the application.


- Separating concerns: The Adapter pattern can be used to separate concerns in an application. By creating a separate Adapter class that adapts one class's interface to another, the Adapter pattern allows the two classes to remain independent and focus on their respective concerns.

Overall, the Adapter pattern is useful in situations where objects with incompatible interfaces need to work together, or where existing classes need to be adapted to work in a new context. By adapting interfaces, the Adapter pattern allows objects to be reused, integrated, or implemented more easily, and can help to simplify the design of an application.
