The Object Pool pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to manage a pool of reusable objects. Here are some common use cases of the Object Pool pattern:

- Resource-intensive objects: If you have a resource-intensive object, such as a database connection or a thread, it can be costly to create and destroy these objects each time they are needed. Object Pool pattern allows these objects to be created once and reused multiple times, improving performance.


- Limiting resource usage: In situations where there is a limit on resources, such as a maximum number of connections to a database, the Object Pool pattern can help by limiting the number of objects created and managing their reuse.


- Improving application performance: Object Pool pattern can be used to improve the overall performance of an application by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying objects.


- Resource sharing: In cases where objects are used by multiple threads or clients, the Object Pool pattern can be used to share objects and ensure that they are used safely and efficiently.


- Object caching: Object Pool pattern can also be used as an object cache to store and reuse frequently used objects.


Overall, the Object Pool pattern is useful in situations where objects are expensive to create or there is a limit on the number of objects that can be created, such as in resource-constrained environments. The pattern helps to improve performance, manage resource usage, and share resources among multiple threads or clients.
