The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different representations of the same object. Here are some common uses of the Builder pattern:

- Simplifying object creation: The Builder pattern simplifies object creation by separating the construction of a complex object into smaller, simpler steps. This makes it easier to create complex objects without having to write complex code.


- Creating complex objects: The Builder pattern is useful when you need to create objects that have a complex structure or require multiple steps to create. For example, you might need to create a report that contains multiple sections and sub-sections, each with its own formatting and content.


- Encapsulating object creation: The Builder pattern encapsulates object creation in a separate object, which makes it easier to modify the object creation process without affecting the rest of the code.


- Supporting different representations: The Builder pattern allows you to create different representations of the same object. For example, you might need to create a report in HTML format and another report in PDF format.


- Promoting code reuse: The Builder pattern promotes code reuse by allowing you to reuse the same building process to create different representations of the same object.

Overall, the Builder pattern is useful when you need to create complex objects that have a complex structure or require multiple steps to create. By separating the construction of a complex object from its representation, you can simplify object creation, encapsulate object creation in a separate o
